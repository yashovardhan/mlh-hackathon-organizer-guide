# Streamyard

Streamyard is the service MLH uses to stream to Twitch, Facebook, and Youtube simultaneously. You can control graphics, layouts, and invite hackers to stream with you. All from the browser.

## **Creating A Broadcast**

* Hit the Create a Broadcast button
* Select which platforms you’d like to stream to \(typically all of them\)
* Give your broadcast a title that will stand the test of time
  * “Marbles” is not a good stream title
  * “Hack at Home Marble Races” is a better stream title
* Include a few sentences of description and whatever logistical information you need to in the description
* Only use schedule for later if you want hackers to see that we’ll be live at a specific time

## **Pro Tips**

* Streamyard works best on **Google Chrome**
* Use a **hardwired connection** for the internet if possible.
* Run an **upload speed check** \(speedtest.net\) and set the stream quality accordingly.
* Grab a pair of **headphones** to reduce feedback.
* Get familiar with Streamyard before going live the first time
* Ensure Streamyard can find your camera and microphone in the Greenroom
* Check your lighting and background.
  * **Background**
    * Ensure your background is simple and fixed, such as a plain wall or a [charming bookcase](https://twitter.com/BCredibility).
    * Most importantly, ensure it’s a background that you are happy to be visible for a long period of time. 
      * Does it reveal any personal or private information? 
      * Is a family member likely to enter frame unexpectedly? 
      * Does it reveal your location?
  * **Lighting**
    * Try to ensure that your face is well and evenly lit with soft, bright white light. 
    * This is a great guide to a [3 point lighting setup](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/an-introduction-to-three-point-lighting/): you don’t necessarily need to buy new lighting equipment, but this guide will help you understand what good lighting is and looks like so you can use what you have, such as cheap desk lamps and daylight, effectively. 
* If you're **adding a guest**, tell them to refer to [this documentation](https://streamyard.com/resources/docs/guest-instructions/)
* **Mute notifications** \(option-click notification centre, top right on Mac\)
* Close unneeded applications.
* Warn your roommates or family that you’ll be on stream and unavailable for a little while.
* You will not be visible or audible to the audience until you are added to the stream and the stream is live.
